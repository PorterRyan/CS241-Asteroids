# CS241-Asteroids
An Asteroids game for the CS 241 class. Utilizes the Python Arcade library with sprites and sound effects from various sources. While many of the final features of the game are my invention, they are implemented in a framework that was partially completed by one of BYU's instructors, Brother Burton.
